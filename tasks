1. Script to convert AST to PDA accepting that AST
- 1.1. Custom walker - preorder
- 1.2. Alphabet - all possible nodes as states (class constructor)
- 1.3. process node = create state in PDA

equality of nodes - what properties matter

2. Unit tests
2.1. alphabet equality - test that each class equals to other class
2.2. "e2e test" - scripts in + out combinations


3. acceptance
3.1. source to AST to nodes list
3.2. iter
